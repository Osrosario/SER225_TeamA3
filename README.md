# SER225-TeamA3

## What is this?
This is a game maintained by Team A3 for Quinnipiac's SER225 class. We were allowed to choose a previous team's project to continue and improve upon, and implemented several enhancements and bug fixes throughout the semester. For more information on our development process, check out the files in the `Important Documents` folder. For information on running the game, read the document `Instructions.docx` in the `Important Documents` folder.

## Team Credits
This project was developed and improved by Michael Merritt, Omar Rosario, Jonathan Mason, and William Siri.
